# Purpose and Advantages of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is used to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next one
 Advantages:

    Decouples sender and receiver: The client doesn’t need to know which handler will process the request

    Flexible processing chain: You can change the order of handlers or add/remove them without changing client code

    Improves code organization: Each handler focuses only on specific concerns, following the Single Responsibility Principle

This pattern is especially useful in technical support systems, middleware pipelines, event processing, or logging frameworks

# Command Pattern – Purpose & Advantages

The Command Pattern is used to encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log operations, and support undoable actions
 Advantages:

    Decouples the invoker from the receiver: The remote control doesn’t need to know how the devices work internally

    Supports undo/redo functionality: Each command knows how to undo its own operation

    Macro commands: You can group multiple commands into one (e.g., "Goodnight Mode")

    Improves scalability and flexibility: Easy to add new commands without modifying existing code

This pattern is ideal for smart home systems, GUI buttons, menu actions, and task scheduling systems
